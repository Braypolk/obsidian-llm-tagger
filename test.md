# Machine Learning Project Notes

Today I worked on implementing a neural network for image classification. The model uses convolutional layers and achieved 95% accuracy on the test set. The training was done using PyTorch and the dataset consisted of 10,000 images.

Key points:
- Used ResNet architecture
- Batch size of 32
- Learning rate of 0.001
- Trained for 50 epochs

Future improvements could include data augmentation and transfer learning approaches.
